# ban_hammer
A simple python script to detect automatically and permanently ban unauthorized SSH and SSHD on Linux machines (detects crawlers, bots, brute force attacks, etc).

Are you a homelab or system admin that constantly needs to keep monitoring internet exposed machines to a multitude of attacks generated by bots, crawlers and malicious agents in general?

I developed this simple solution to permanently ban any unauthorized access attempt to the SSH or SSHD service, in a way that it can be customizable and simple to use.

The only external requirement is the installation of netfilter-persistent via sudo apt install iptables-persistent.

Usage:
ban_hammer [OPTIONS]

SOURCE OPTIONS:
--silent
  run silently without any console output, logs are however still generated to /var/log/ban_hammer.log

--threshold
  sets a threshold of maximum attempts before network ban is generated. Only accepts integers.

--period
  sets the period of time that the program will query from journalctl. Accepts all formats used in journalctl.
